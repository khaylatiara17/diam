# acotz Group

Welcome to the acotz Group project. This is a modern web project that leverages Swiper to create engaging, responsive, and interactive user experiences.

## Overview
The acotz Group project is designed to showcase a sleek, mobile-friendly website featuring:
- A full-screen hero section with looping slides.
- Dynamic content sections including About, Services, and CTA.
- Integration with external resources (e.g., Swiper, Bootstrap) to provide modern UI elements and smooth animations.

## Technologies
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [Swiper JS](https://swiperjs.com/) for the hero slider
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design
