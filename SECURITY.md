# Website Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines measures to secure all project files and website functionality from phishing, scams, and hacking methods.

## Common Threats
- Phishing: Fake emails and duplicate sites designed to steal user information.
- Scam: Social engineering and fraudulent schemes targeting unsuspecting users.
- Hacking: Exploits such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), CSRF, and other vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices for Protection
- Enforce HTTPS for all communications.
- Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce XSS risks.
- Use strong authentication methods including two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrative access.
- Enable secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure).
- Validate all user inputs and use parameterized queries.
- Regularly update software dependencies and perform patch management.
- Educate users about phishing and scam attempts through awareness programs.

## Technical Measures and Monitoring
- Implement anti-CSRF tokens on forms.
- Use intrusion detection and monitoring systems.
- Enable detailed logging and perform regular audits.
- Schedule routine vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- Maintain secure backups and disaster recovery plans.

## Advanced Security Measures
- Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block suspicious traffic.
- Implement rate limiting and IP blacklisting to prevent brute force attacks.
- Utilize automated vulnerability scanning and continuous penetration testing.
- Enforce advanced security headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security).
- Adopt secure coding practices and use robust security frameworks.
- Implement real-time monitoring and behavioral analysis to detect and block hacking attempts.
